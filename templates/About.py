<h2>My view about maths and programing</h2>
<strong> Mathematics:</strong> 
I see the world through mathematics, understand things through mathematical reasoning and seem like everything is mathematics 
 </p>
<p>
<strong> Programming:</strong> 
I found programing very useful where I can do amazing things to advance my disciplines and atleast know how the world of technology work.
